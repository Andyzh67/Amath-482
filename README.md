# Amath 482 at University of Washington: Computational Methods for Data Analysis - WI 2020
Including all 5 reports and corresponding Matlab codes
- HW1: An Ultrasound Problem
-- Analyze ultrasound data to filter out the noise and find the path of a marble swallowed by the dog.
- HW2: Gabor Transform
-- Use Gabor Transform to do time-frequency analysis on Handel's Messiah and reproduce the music scores played in Mary had a little lamb.
- HW3: Principal Component Analysis
-- Use principal component analysis on movie files created from three different cameras in four cases, with different degrees of noise influences.
- HW4: Music Classification
-- Apply machine learning to do music classification in three cases, band classification (different genres), band classification (same genre), and genre classification.
- HW5: Neural Networks for Classifying Fashion MNIST
-- Explore on deep learning neural networks (fully-connected and convolutional) that could accurately classify fashion MNIST dataset.
